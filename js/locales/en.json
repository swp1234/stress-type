      "desc": "You are The Overthinker — your stress lives in your head. Tension clusters around your head, eyes, and jaw, and when faced with pressure, you tend to freeze or flee. You replay worst-case scenarios on loop and delay action until everything feels perfect. This type is prone to analysis paralysis, so the key is to get out of your head and into your body.",

        "Set a daily 15-minute 'worry window' — postpone all worrying outside of it",

You react strongly to injustice and follow a cycle of suppressing emotions until they burst. Anger itself is natural, but uncontrolled outbursts can damage relationships and health. The key is finding healthy outlets before the pressure becomes unbearable.",
      "tips": [
        "When anger rises, remove yourself immediately and count to 10 slowly",

You struggle to say no and push yourself to meet everyone's expectations until you collapse. When faced with conflict, you run or sacrifice yourself. Building healthy boundaries and prioritizing your own needs is the most important thing you can do.",
      "tips": [
        "Practice saying 'no' once a day, starting with small things",

Your energy is completely depleted; when stress hits, you either shut down or collapse. Rest doesn't recharge you, and things you once loved feel meaningless. Left unchecked, this can evolve into chronic depression or serious illness — self-care must be your top priority right now.",
      "tips": [
        "Schedule 30 minutes of 'doing absolutely nothing' in your calendar daily",
